### Phase 5: Launch & Monitor
**Continuous Improvement**

1. **Staged Rollout**
   - Internal testing
   - Beta with trusted users
   - Gradual percentage rollout
   - Monitor metrics closely

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Model accuracy over time

- Provide examples
- Simple language explanations
- Visual representations
- Allow questioning/appeals

### Privacy & Security
AI systems handle sensitive data.

**Best Practices:**
- Data minimization
- Differential privacy
- Secure data pipelines
- User consent
- Right to deletion
- Audit trails

- F1 Score: Balance of precision and recall
- AUC-ROC: Overall model performance

**Choose based on use case:**
- High precision: When false positives are costly
- High recall: When false negatives are costly
- Balance: When both matter equally

### User Experience Metrics
- Task success rate

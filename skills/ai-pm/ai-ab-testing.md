- Bias testing across demographics
- Regular audits
- Transparency about limitations
- User feedback loops

### Explainability
Users need to understand AI decisions.

**Approaches:**
- Show contributing factors
- Provide examples
- Simple language explanations
- Visual representations
- Allow questioning/appeals

### Privacy & Security
AI systems handle sensitive data.

**Best Practices:**
- Data minimization
- Differential privacy
- Secure data pipelines
- User consent
- Right to deletion
- Audit trails

**Choose based on use case:**
- High precision: When false positives are costly
- High recall: When false negatives are costly
- Balance: When both matter equally

### User Experience Metrics
- Task success rate
- Time to complete task
- User satisfaction (CSAT)
- Trust indicators
- Feature adoption
- Return usage

### Business Impact Metrics
- Automation rate (% handled by AI)
- Cost savings

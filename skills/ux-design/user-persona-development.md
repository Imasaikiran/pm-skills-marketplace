## When to Use
- Starting new product development
- Entering new markets

## Research-Based Persona Creation

### Step 1: Gather Data
**Quantitative:**
- Analytics data
- Survey responses
- Usage patterns
- Demographics

**Qualitative:**
- User interviews (5-10 per segment)
- Customer support tickets
- Sales conversations
- Social media feedback

### Step 2: Identify Patterns
Look for clusters:
- Similar goals
- Common behaviors
- Shared pain points
- Usage patterns

### Step 3: Segment Users
Group by:
- Behavior patterns (not just demographics)
- Goals and motivations
- Tech sophistication
- Use cases

### Step 4: Build Personas
Create 3-5 primary personas:
- Too few: Miss important segments
- Too many: Dilute focus

### Step 5: Validate
- Share with team
- Test against real users
- Refine based on feedback
- Update as you learn

## Persona vs. Other Tools

### Personas vs. User Segments

## Using Personas

### In Product Decisions
Ask: "Would Sarah find this valuable?"
"Does this solve Michael's time problem?"

### In Design Reviews
Reference personas to evaluate designs:
- Is this too complex for Michael?
- Does this give Sarah the data she needs?

### In Prioritization
Weight features by persona impact:
- How many personas does this serve?
- Does it address primary or secondary goals?

### In Marketing
Craft messaging for each persona:
- Different pain points
- Different value props
- Different channels

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Making Up Data
- Don't invent without research
- Base on real user insights

### ❌ Too Many Personas
- 3-5 primary is ideal
- More creates confusion

### ❌ Focusing on Demographics Alone
- Age/gender less important than behavior
- Focus on goals and patterns

### ❌ Creating Once and Forgetting
- Personas evolve
- Update regularly
- Validate continuously

### ❌ Treating as Requirements
- Personas guide, don't dictate
- Real users are more diverse

---

## Proto-Personas

**When:** Early stage, limited research

**How:** Team workshop to align on assumptions

**Process:**
1. Each person sketches a user
2. Share and discuss
3. Identify commonalities
4. Create draft persona
5. Plan research to validate

**Important:** Clearly mark as assumptions, validate with real research

---

## Personas in Agile

### In User Stories
```
As Sarah (Scale-Up PM),
I want to see all my metrics in one dashboard,
So I can quickly assess product health without switching tools
```

### In Sprint Planning
- Which persona does this sprint serve?
- Are we neglecting any personas?

### In Retrospectives
- Did we stay focused on user needs?
- What did we learn about our personas?

---

## Updating Personas

### When to Update
- Quarterly review
- After major product changes
- When entering new markets
- After significant research

### What to Update
- Behaviors (as product evolves)
- Tools they use (market changes)
- Pain points (as you solve them)
- Goals (as they progress)

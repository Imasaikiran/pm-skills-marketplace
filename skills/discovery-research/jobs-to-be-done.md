# Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework

## Description
Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding customer motivations by focusing on the "job" they're trying to accomplish rather than demographics or product features.

## When to Use
- Understanding why customers buy your product
- Identifying unmet customer needs
- Developing new product ideas
- Improving product positioning and marketing
- Conducting competitive analysis from a customer perspective
- Designing better user experiences

## Core Concept

### The Job Statement
**"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."**

Example:
- "When I'm commuting to work, I want to stay informed about industry news, so I can contribute meaningfully in meetings."

### Key Principle
People don't buy products; they "hire" them to get a job done.

## The JTBD Framework

### 1. Functional Jobs
**What task is the customer trying to complete?**

Examples:
- "Cut my lawn"
- "Prepare dinner for my family"
- "Learn a new language"
- "Track my business expenses"

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the customer trying to accomplish?
- What steps are involved in completing this job?
- What defines success for this job?

---

### 2. Emotional Jobs
**How does the customer want to feel?**

Examples:
- "Feel confident in my decisions"
- "Reduce anxiety about finances"
- "Feel like a good parent"
- "Project professionalism to clients"

**Questions to Ask:**
- How do they want to feel while doing the job?
- What emotional outcome are they seeking?
- What are they afraid of?
- What would give them peace of mind?

---

### 3. Social Jobs
**How does the customer want to be perceived?**

Examples:
- "Be seen as tech-savvy"
- "Demonstrate environmental consciousness"
- "Show I care about my team"
- "Project success to peers"

**Questions to Ask:**
- Who is watching?
- How do they want others to perceive them?
- What would embarrass them?
- What would impress their peers?

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify the Job
Define the main job customers are hiring your product to do

**Framework:**
```markdown
When [situation/context]
I want to [motivation/action]
So I can [expected outcome]
```

### Step 2: Map the Job Timeline

**Before (Little Hire)**
- First thought about doing the job
- Looking for solutions
- Deciding between options

**During (Big Hire)**
- Using the product/service
- Getting the job done
- Experiencing outcomes

**After (Ongoing Use)**
- Maintaining the solution
- Seeking better alternatives
- Recommending to others

### Step 3: Identify Job Steps
Break down the job into smaller steps

Example - Job: "Prepare a healthy dinner"
1. Decide what to cook
2. Find a recipe
3. Check ingredients
4. Shop for missing items
5. Prepare ingredients
6. Cook the meal
7. Serve and enjoy
8. Clean up

### Step 4: Uncover Needs and Outcomes
For each step, identify:
- Desired outcomes
- Pain points
- Workarounds
- Metrics for success

### Step 5: Analyze the Competition
Who else is being "hired" for this job?
- Direct competitors
- Indirect competitors
- Non-consumption (DIY, doing nothing)

## JTBD Interview Questions

### Discovery Questions
- "Tell me about the last time you [job]"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"
- "Why was that important to you?"
- "What else did you try before this?"
- "What would happen if you couldn't do this job?"

### Timeline Questions
- "What triggered you to look for a solution?"
- "How did you first hear about [product]?"
- "What alternatives did you consider?"
- "What made you choose [product]?"
- "How has life changed since you started using it?"

### Context Questions
- "Where were you when this happened?"
- "Who was involved in the decision?"
- "What was going on in your life at that time?"
- "How much time did you spend on this?"

### Outcome Questions
- "What does success look like?"
- "How do you know when you're done?"
- "What would make this better?"
- "What's frustrating about the current solution?"

## JTBD vs. Personas

### Traditional Personas
- Who the customer IS
- Demographics, psychographics
- Static representation
- Descriptive

### JTBD
- What the customer is TRYING TO DO
- Circumstances, motivations
- Situational context
- Predictive

**Best Practice:** Use both together
- Personas: Who to target
- JTBD: Why they'll buy

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Focusing on Product Features**
   - Wrong: "Use our app to track calories"
   - Right: "Achieve fitness goals without obsessing over food"

2. **Confusing Tasks with Jobs**
   - Task: "Open a spreadsheet"
   - Job: "Analyze sales trends to make better inventory decisions"

3. **Making Jobs Too Broad**
   - Too broad: "Be successful"
   - Better: "Advance my career without sacrificing family time"

4. **Ignoring Context**
   - Jobs are situational
   - Same person has different jobs in different contexts
   - Context triggers the need

5. **Assuming the Job**
   - Don't guess - interview customers
   - Look for what they actually do, not what they say

6. **Stopping at Functional Jobs**
   - Emotional and social jobs are often more powerful
   - They differentiate you from competitors

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Focus on the Job, Not the Customer**
   - Jobs are stable, customers change
   - Target the job, reach many customers

2. **Look for Struggle Stories**
   - Best insights come from how people struggle
   - "Tell me about a time when..."

3. **Study Switching Moments**
   - When people switch solutions, they reveal what matters
   - Ask about the decision to switch

4. **Observe Workarounds**
   - Creative solutions reveal unmet needs
   - "How do you currently handle this?"

5. **Map the Entire Job Journey**
   - Before, during, and after purchase
   - Each phase has different jobs

6. **Identify Non-Consumption**
   - Biggest competitor is often doing nothing
   - Why do people not do the job?

7. **Quantify Outcomes**
   - "How do you measure success?"
   - Metrics reveal priorities

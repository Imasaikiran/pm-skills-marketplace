## The Growth Hacking Framework

### Phase 1: Product-Market Fit First
**Before growth hacking:**
- Validate core value proposition
- Achieve retention benchmarks
- Confirm willingness to pay
- Establish referral baseline

**Don't scale a broken product**

### Phase 2: Identify Growth Levers
**Map the customer journey:**
1. Awareness
2. Acquisition
3. Activation
4. Retention
5. Revenue
6. Referral

**Find the bottleneck:**
- Where's the biggest drop-off?
- Which stage has most leverage?
- What's easiest to move?

### Phase 3: Generate Growth Ideas
**Brainstorm across categories:**
- Content marketing
- Viral mechanics
- Partnerships
- Optimization
- Automation

### Phase 4: Prioritize Experiments
**Use ICE scoring:**
- **I**mpact (1-10)
- **C**onfidence (1-10)
- **E**ase (1-10)

ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease

### Phase 5: Run Rapid Experiments
**One week sprints:**
- Monday: Plan experiment
- Tuesday-Thursday: Execute
- Friday: Analyze results
- Repeat

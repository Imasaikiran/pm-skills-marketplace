## Managing Difficult Conversations

### Saying No to Features

**Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "I understand this is important to you"
2. **Explain:** Share the reasoning (data, strategy, priorities)
3. **Offer Alternative:** What can you do instead?
4. **Timeline:** When might this be reconsidered?

**Example:**
"I understand the sales team really wants custom branding. Given our current focus on retention (where we're seeing 25% churn), we need to prioritize features that keep existing users engaged. What if we start with basic theme options this quarter and revisit full customization in Q3?"

### Delivering Bad News

**Framework:**
1. **Direct:** Lead with the news, don't bury it
2. **Context:** Explain what happened
3. **Impact:** Clarify how this affects them
4. **Plan:** Share next steps
5. **Support:** Offer to discuss

**Example:**
"The mobile app launch is delayed by 3 weeks. During testing, we discovered performance issues that affect user experience. This means the launch date moves from March 15 to April 5. I know this impacts the campaign timing. Let's discuss how to adjust the marketing plan."

### Handling Conflicting Priorities

**Framework:**
1. **Surface the conflict:** Make it explicit
2. **Clarify criteria:** What matters most?
3. **Present options:** Trade-offs for each choice
4. **Facilitate decision:** Help stakeholders decide
5. **Document:** Record decision and rationale
